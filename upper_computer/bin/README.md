# Bin file introduction

FFmpeg plug-ins need to be installed in this directory. You can download them from the ffmpeg official website. 

Note that it is not an installation package, but a bin file. 

You can download them directly on GitHub. Here is the Windows version: [ffmpeg](https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases)

You need to download other versions from ffmpeg and put "ffmpeg.exe, ffplay.exe and ffprobe. Exe" in this directory

Note that it is necessary to ensure that these files can be executed separately, because the host computer program will call them
