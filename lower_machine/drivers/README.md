# Driver Directory Introduction
In order to better expand on AI projects, we have developed drivers for some specific hardware, so that developers do not need to care about external hardware, but only need to focus on the code related to AI business logic.

Some peripherals, such as motion sensors, are inevitably used in AI projects, but zephyr has less support for music peripherals and camera peripherals. If we want to carry out face recognition and speech analysis on microchips, these peripherals will inevitably be used. In order to enable developers to quickly carry out AI project development based on this framework, they do not need to care about hardware, Therefore, this driver directory is created to develop AI related peripheral drivers on zephyr platform.
